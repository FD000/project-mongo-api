# Mongo API Project

I have created a dataset with list of books and created several endpoints for it, some with single result and some returning an array of results. 

Endpoints: 
1) .../books - Get access to all data in our collection
2) .../books/:memberId - Search book by id
3) .../books/name/:authorName - Search and find book by author name
4) .../books/minpage/:pages - Search and find book by filtering minimum page the books have
5) .../books/maxpage/:pages - Search and find book by filtering maximum page the books have
6) .../books/isbn/:isbn - Search and find book by isbn number
7) .../highestrated - List top 20 highest rated books

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
