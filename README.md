# Mongo API Project

I have created a dataset with list of books and created several endpoints for it, some with single result and some returning an array of results. 

Endpoints: 
1) .../books - Get access to all data in our collection
2) .../books/:memberId - Search book by id
3) .../books/name/:authorName - Search and find book by author name
4) .../books/minpage/:pages - Search and find book by filtering minimum page the books have
5) .../books/maxpage/:pages - Search and find book by filtering maximum page the books have
6) .../books/isbn/:isbn - Search and find book by isbn number
7) .../highestrated - List top 20 highest rated books
